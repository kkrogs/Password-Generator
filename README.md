The title of this project is Password-Generator. The reason why this project is so important is because it will showcase my knowledge of Javascript to prospective employers.

HOW IT WORKS: If you click on the red "Generate Password" button in the midde of the page, you will be presented with a prompt asking "How many characters in your password would you like to use? It can be between 8 and 128 characters." to which you can respond with a number that is within those parameters.

After responding, you will then be presented with a series of confirmation options asking if you want lowercase letters in your password,uppercase,numeric, and special characters in your password. See the below photos for what the series of confirmation questions will look like:

After being asked a series of confirmation questions, the password generator will then generate a password based on the responses in the confirmation questions, such as the one shown below:

On the flipside, should you choose to run the password generator again and answer a number outside of the given password character parameters, less than 8 or more than 128, to the initial question of "How many characters in your password would you like to use? It can be between 8 and 128 characters." the program will alert "Please choose greater than 8 characters and less than 128 characters!" such as the photo shown below. After pressing "ok" you will be prompted the same question.

If you choose 'cancel' to all of the following confirmational questions, you will be alerted with "You have to choose at least one!"
